===============================

Game play begins with a board consisting of grass, stone and water.
At the top of the board there are indicators showing the player's score, lives remaining and level.
The player must travel to reach the water from the beginning point in the grass.
You may move the player by using the arrow keys on your keyboard. 
Up moves forward.
Left and right move ...um ... left and right. 
Down moves backward (away from the water).
Avoid the enemy bugs! Any contact with the bugs will take away a life and reset the player's location.
Collect gems for additional points!
Each time you reach the water you go up a level.
BEWARE! As the level increases the number of enemies also increase!
The more points the better, every 2000 points gains a new life!
The game is over when the player loses all of the lives.
